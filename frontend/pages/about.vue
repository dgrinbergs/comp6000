  <h1>About Us</h1><br>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <div>
    We are Final Year Computer Science Students at the University of Kent.<br>
    Our project's aim was to create an application which creates houses and
    buildings in Minecraft based on feedback provided by the user of a frontend webpage.<br>
    The feedback provided powers a AI system which uses a Genetic Algorithm to create a
    number of buildings of varying materials and block types.<br>
    SmartGen allows users to create buildings in Minecraft without ever setting foot in the game itself.
